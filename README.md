## Runing Project
- You have to download OpenCV from this Documentation [link](https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_setup_Qt_and_openCV_on_Windows)
- You can also follow the steps in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOSu-2Oju-A) 

## Description 
It is a desktop application that allows users to do image processing.

## Features 
- User can browse images from his pc to do image processing.
- The project contains 7 tabs:
  1 - User can add Uniform, Gaussian and salt & pepper noise to the uploaded image and also can apply Average, Gaussian and median filters.
  2 - User is able to apply Sobel , Roberts , Prewitt and Canny edge detectors. 
  3 - User can check the histogram and distribution curve of the uploaded picture.
  4 - User can normalize and equalize the image.
  5 - User is capable of applying local and global thresholding.
  6 - User could transform an image from RGB to gray scale image and plot of R, G, and B histograms with its distribution function.
  7 - User can apply two types of frequency domain filters (low pass filter & high pass filter) and can merge two images after applying different filters on them. 

## Technology Used:
The Desktop Application is built using:
- Qt6 Creator using C++ .
